#### 1. Consider the GDP information in global_economy. Plot the GDP per capita for each country over time. Which country has the highest GDP per capita? How has this changed over time?
```{r gdp_per_capita}

global_economy |>
  autoplot(GDP / Population, show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "GDP per capita", y = "$US")

sa_countries <- c("Argentina", "Brazil", "Chile", "Colombia", "Peru", "Venezuela", "Ecuador", "Bolivia")

sa_global_economy <- global_economy |> 
  filter(Country %in% sa_countries)

sa_global_economy |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = GDP / Population)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~ Country, scales = "free_y") + 
  labs(title = "GDP per Capita of South American Countries", 
       y = "GDP per Capita", 
       x = "Year")

```

<p> Monaco has the greatest GDP per capita as it is a known tax haven. This has increased year on year with a slight dip around the 2008 financial crisis and the pandemic but it has since recovered.</p>

#### 2. For each of the following series, make a graph of the data. If transforming seems appropriate, do so and describe the effect.

```{r transform}

us_gdp <- global_economy |>
  filter(Country == "United States")

us_gdp |> autoplot()

vic_livestock <- aus_livestock |>
  filter(State == "Victoria", Animal == "Bulls, bullocks and steers")

vic_livestock |> autoplot()

v <- vic_elec |>
  group_by(Date) |>
  mutate(Demand = sum(Demand)) |>
  distinct(Date, Demand)

v |> as_tsibble(index = Date) |>
  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "Daily Victoria Electricity Demand")

v |> mutate(Date = yearmonth(Date)) |>
  group_by(Date) |>
  summarise(Demand = sum(Demand)) |>
  as_tsibble(index = Date) |>
  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "Monthly Victoria Electricity Demand")

aus_production |>
  autoplot(Gas)

lambda <- aus_production |>
  features(Gas, features = guerrero) |>
  pull(lambda_guerrero)

aus_production |>
  autoplot(box_cox(Gas, lambda)) +
  labs(y = "", title = TeX(paste0("Transformed Gas Production with $\\lambda$ = ",
         round(lambda,2))))

```

<p> The US retail and Victorian bulls, bullocks and steers data did not require any transformation. However, due to the volume of the the data, the Victoria Electricity demand was transformed into monthly demand for better visibility. The Canadian gas data utilised the Guerrero method which normalised the variance in the data. </p>

#### Why is a Box-Cox transformation unhelpful for the canadian_gas data?

```{r ca_gas}

canadian_gas |> 
  autoplot(Volume) +
  labs(title = "Non-Transformed Gas Production")

lambda <- canadian_gas |>
  features(Volume, features = guerrero) |>
  pull(lambda_guerrero)

canadian_gas |> 
  autoplot(box_cox(Volume, lambda)) +
  labs( y = "", title = TeX(paste0("Transformed Gas Production with $\\lambda$ = ",
         round(lambda,2))))

```
<p> The Box-Cox transformation is unhelpful because it doesn't effectively flatten the variation in the time series. For example, the period between 1980 Jan and 1990 Jan still has large amounts of variation compared to the rest of the observations.</p>

#### What Box-Cox transformation would you select for your retail data (from Exercise 7 in Section 2.10)?

```{r bc_retaildata}

set.seed(123)
myseries <- aus_retail %>%
  filter(`Series ID` == sample(aus_retail$`Series ID`,1)) 

myseries |> autoplot(Turnover)
```

```{r gf_retaildata}

lambda <- myseries |>
  features(Turnover, features = guerrero) |>
  pull(lambda_guerrero)
myseries |>
  autoplot(box_cox(Turnover, lambda)) +
  labs(y = "",
       title = paste("Transformation with lambda = ", round(lambda,2)))

```

#### For the following series, find an appropriate Box-Cox transformation in order to stabilise the variance. Tobacco from aus_production, Economy class passengers between Melbourne and Sydney from ansett, and Pedestrian counts at Southern Cross Station from pedestrian.

```{r tobacco}

tobacco <- aus_production |>
  select(Quarter = index(aus_production), Tobacco)

tobacco |> autoplot()

lambda <- tobacco |>
  features(tobacco, features = guerrero) |>
  pull(lambda_guerrero)

tobacco |>
  autoplot(box_cox(Tobacco, lambda)) +
  labs(y = "",
       title = paste("Transformation of Tobacco with lambda = ", round(lambda,2)))

```

<p> The Box-Cox transformation is not helpful for the tobacco data since it is just set to 1 with little transformation.</p>

```{r economy_passengers}

economy_mel_syd <- ansett |>
  filter(Airports == "MEL-SYD", 
         Class == "Economy")

economy_mel_syd |> autoplot()

lambda <- economy_mel_syd |>
  features(Passengers, features = guerrero) |>
  pull(lambda_guerrero)

economy_mel_syd |>
  autoplot(box_cox(Passengers, lambda)) +
  labs(y = "",
       title = paste("Transformation of Passengers with lambda = ", round(lambda,2)))

```

<p> For the passenger data the transformation outlines the variation a little clearer.</p>

```{r pedestrian}

southern_cross <- pedestrian |>
  filter(Sensor == "Southern Cross Station")

southern_cross |> autoplot(Count)

lambda <- southern_cross |>
  features(Count, features = guerrero) |>
  pull(lambda_guerrero)

southern_cross |>
  autoplot(box_cox(Count, lambda)) +
  labs(y = "",
       title = paste("Transformation of Cross Station Count with lambda = ", round(lambda,2)))

```

<p> The Guerrero transformation helps to recognise greater varation compared to the original plot. </p>

#### Consider the last five years of the Gas data from aus_production.

```{r aus_gas}

gas <- tail(aus_production, 5*4) |> select(Gas)

gas |> autoplot()

gas_dcmp <- gas |> 
  model(classical_decomposition(Gas, type = "multiplicative"))

components(gas_dcmp) |>
  autoplot()

```

<p> From the first plot, there is a clear trend showing a gradual increase in gas production with seasonal increases during Q3 and Q4 with big drops during Q1 each year. 

The results from the decomposition support the graphical interpretation from part a, showing a clear trend and seasonality with the data.</p>

```{r aus_gas_seasonality}

components(gas_dcmp) |>
  as_tsibble() |>
  autoplot(Gas, color = "gray") +
  geom_line(aes(y=season_adjust), color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Seasonally Adjusted Gas Production")

```

#### Recall your retail time series data (from Exercise 7 in Section 2.10). Decompose the series using X-11. Does it reveal any outliers, or unusual features that you had not noticed previously?

```{r x11}



tute1 <- readr::read_csv("tute1.csv")

tutets <- tute1 |>
  mutate(Quarter = yearquarter(Quarter)) |>
  as_tsibble(index = Quarter)

start_year <- year(min(tutets$Quarter))
start_quarter <- quarter(min(tutets$Quarter))
frequency <- 4  # Quarterly data

# Convert to ts object
sales_ts <- ts(tutets$Sales, start = c(start_year, start_quarter), frequency = frequency)

# Perform X-11 decomposition
decomposed_sales <- seas(sales_ts, x11 = "")

plot(decomposed_sales)

```

<p> An outlier can be seen marked by the LS around 2003 range with LS defining the Level Shift in the time series which is a sudden change.</p>

#### Write about 3â€“5 sentences describing the results of the decomposition. Pay particular attention to the scales of the graphs in making your interpretation.

<p> The decompositions shows a clear upward trend in the data with a falling seasonality with a slight uptick after 2008. This could be originally due to the decline of retail shopping and the bounce back from the 2008 financial crisis. </p>

#### Is the recession of 1991/1992 visible in the estimated components?

<p> There is a drop in manpower around 1991 and 1992 on the remainder graph, indicating less manpower was employed during this time. </p>

#### Can you produce a plausible seasonally adjusted series?

```{r last_}

canadian_gas |>
 model(
    STL(Volume ~ trend(window = 21) +
                   season(window = 13),
    robust = TRUE)) |>
  components() |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Month)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Volume, colour = "Data")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = season_adjust,
                colour = "Seasonally Adjusted")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = trend, colour = "Trend")) +
  labs(title = "STL decomposition of Canadian Gas Production") +
  scale_colour_manual(
    values = c("gray", "#0072B2", "#D55E00"),
    breaks = c("Data", "Seasonally Adjusted", "Trend"))

```

#### Can you produce a plausible seasonally adjusted series?

```{r last_1}

canadian_gas |>
  model(x11 = X_13ARIMA_SEATS(Volume ~ x11())) %>%
  components() |>
  autoplot()+
  labs(title = "X-11 decomposition of Canadian Gas Production")

canadian_gas |>
  model(seats = X_13ARIMA_SEATS(Volume ~ seats())) |>
  components() |>
autoplot() +
  labs(title ="SEATS Decomposition of Canadian Gas Production")

```

<p> There is little difference between these graphs outside of the SEATS decomposition having a higher variance when it comes to remainders. However, due to this the X11 decomposition fits the Canadian gas data better. </p>
